## Description
This repository was built to practice my node.js, express.js and modularization skills. I created a RESTful API to accept GET, POST and DELETE requests which will read/write/delete to files that keep track of notes. This was a great experience to practice how to handle requests on the server side. I'm looking forward to expanding on this in the next module.
